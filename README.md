# Employee-Promotion
### Project Statement
The primary aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately evaluates and predicts employee promotions based on various features within the dataset. A significant focus is placed on ensuring the fairness and unbiased nature of the model, particularly with regard to gender, to ensure equal opportunity for promotions.

To achieve these aims, the project follows a series of structured objectives:

1. **Data Pre-processing:** 
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and applying necessary transformations to optimize model performance.
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.

2. **Data Visualization:** 
   - Create visualizations such as histograms, count plots, pie charts, and heatmaps to illustrate the distribution of features and their relationship with the target variable (promotion).
   - Visualize class distributions before and after applying Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset.

3. **Feature Engineering:** 
   - Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
   - Standardize numeric features to ensure equal contribution to the model.

4. **Model Building and Evaluation:** 
   - Develop a Logistic Regression model to predict employee promotions.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets to validate the model.

5. **Addressing Imbalance:** 
   - Apply SMOTE to balance the dataset, ensuring the model performs well on both promoted and non-promoted classes.

6. **Assessing Fairness and Bias:** 
   - Evaluate the model for potential bias, particularly with respect to gender.
   - Compare performance metrics (accuracy, positive rate, recall) for male and female groups to identify significant differences.
   - Ensure the model adheres to fairness criteria, such as demographic parity and equal opportunity, preventing bias.

By fulfilling these objectives, the project aims to develop a robust, fair, and accurate model for predicting employee promotions, ensuring no group is unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged.
